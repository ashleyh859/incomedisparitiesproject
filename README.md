# Income Disparities Among Individuals with Work Disabilities

For our INFO 3370 Studying Social Inequality wit Data Science course final project, my group members, Dora Xu, Ying Lin Zhao, and I aim to explore income trends among individuals with work disabilities, considering variations based on race and sex to gain insights into the economic disparities faced by this demographic.

In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was enacted to address the rights of individuals with disabilities, aiming to provide equal opportunities in various domains, including employment. Our group, comprising my group members and myself, seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of this legislation by examining employment rates and income disparities among individuals aged 25-55 with disabilities in the United States.

Research Questions
1. What is the proportion of people in the US from ages 25-55 with disabilities working full-time, part-time, and unemployed?
2. How has the wage gap for people with and without disabilities changed over time?
3. What income trends exist between people with disabilities based on their race and sex?

We utilized R language for data analysis and employed various techniques, including data cleaning, filtering, and visualization using ggplot.
